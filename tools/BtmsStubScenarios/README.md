# BTMS Stub Scenarios

When BTMS changes, and we need updated scenarios, run this tool to collect the data for the CHEDs and movements configured.

Command line arguments are needed to run this console app.

Speak to a developer on the team but the expected values should be:

```
"[https://btms-dev-host]" "[password]"
```

The above should be replaced with the correct values.
